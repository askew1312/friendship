Thirteen, after all, was about when I started to experience real shame, to have real secrets. Real at the time – crushes and small betrayals, the time I locked gazes with a salamander, and picked it up, and its tail fell off and I thought I had killed it, the first thing I ever killed, and also the Smarties I’d pocket at Safeway because I knew Delilah liked them, and I liked her to be happy. I never told anyone where they came from. The secrets were building up in me like kindling, and I’d count them to fall asleep, and my dreams were sweet and full of secrets too. \n</p>\n<p>\nJoey came to talk to our Civics class. Joey Rogers was a twenty-five year old functionary of the Department of Honesty who looked like an off-brand K-pop star, an angel made human. My best friend Delilah and I immediately decided to love him forever, and I hung on his every word – the sounds and shapes of his lips, his dimple and his three cowlicks – while he welcomed us to the age of majority, and showed us how do the reports. He explained how lucky we were that we didn’t have the draconian lengthy punishments for crimes like in the olden days, and that the system relied on little boys and girls like us telling all our rule-breaking to the proctors. Our collective punishements – the loss of recess as a class, or silent days, would end, and instead we would be assigned small punishments – loss of a few minutes of recess per infraction, or lines to write, or maybe special visits with a counselor. \n</p>\n<p>\nTo win his love, I spent days remembering my crimes, confessing everything I thought might have broken a rule. I purged myself of them, and though Joey was two cities over, in Biloxi, by the next day doing the same presentation to another class of anxious and pimpled faces, I always felt the same sense of childhood heartache  and eagerness to please when I visited the proctors, all of whom were warm and compelling when doling out community service or fines. In college, where everyone first started to really break serious rules, drinking underaged at parties or plagiarizing serious papers, the proctors were athletic and vigorous. Once, after I was particularly drunk I went streaking, and Delilah told our proctor. Maybe it was innocent, maybe she thought I would have told him. I didn’t. He mentioned it to me, slyly, at the end of our session and I flushed – the streaking would have only earned me perhaps three hours reshelving library books with the ancient, organic smell of well-worn paper mildewing, the mahagony smell of innumerable grad students’ coffee as they labored until dawn on the countours of their arguments, the sweet chemical smell of the proctors’ censoring pens. But having not said anything was much worse. He smiled though, and touched my hand and told me it was fine, and asked me to tell him how streaking felt that night, after a glass of wine. It ended up being more than one glass, but just one night. Afterwards, he was just my proctor again. \n</p>\n<p>\nAfter a while, my guilty passion for secret rule breaking returned, though never in front of Delilah again. I blame that first crush on Joey, or what Joey woke up in me. But when I knew I’d done something I’d have to report, it would feed some wild fire inside of me. Years later, once I’d graduated and become a copywriter for Zara, I became bored and started to break rules to feed that fire. Jaywalking. Loitering. Littering, once, though I thought better of it and looped back to pick up the blank page I had torn out of my diary, the crumpled eye of it accusing me from the side of the road. \n</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\n<p>\n  My assigned confession time was Wednesdays at 2:30, and while I’d still report the kinds of lawbreaking I used to, I didn’t tell about the crimes I’d been comitting to feed the fire. It wasn’t the fines – I had been doing well at work. It was the pleasure of having a secret, burning deep within me. I was a criminal now, and I treasured the secret knowledge. I imagined my crimes like the votive candles in ancient churches, each one purchased with a crime and lit with a prayer, together forming a warm bank oflight.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I still told them about the accidental infractions, or the ones I did from selfishness or convenience rather than to feed the delicious feeling. The proctor would send us to the Community Building Center where we’d travel on busses to fix potholes or clear to clear litter and tents and other trash from the roadside, then brought back through the tall gates to the dorms at night to reflect on what had led us astray in Group. They granted these with a warm smile, always reminding us of the generosity of the state in provising this free theraputic opportunity. Almost everyone visted the Centers occasionally, and half the couples I knew had met in Group and fallen in love watching each other reflect on what had caused them to stray. The group sessions were recorded, and behavioral scientists would watch them and engineer public policies to help people stay healthier.  \n</p>\n<p>\n  The worst part was knowing as I was talking to my coworkers, cooing over their dogs, selecting the right oils for handmade secret santa bath bombs, engaging in little platonic flirtations, smelling them and feeling their warmth and just feeling like part of this thing, I knew they’d give me up in an instant. I’d seen them come for others, and no one did anything. We just stopped talking about them. It was like they never existed. But I couldn’t my crimes, and didn’t want to. In in these small acts I carved out and tended a decadent and esoteric garden where I could live deliciously.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\n<p>\n  I started to talk to Delilah about all this over martinis Tuesday, but her eyebrows dissapeared into her bangs in that look of consternation I remembered playing across her face at five, when I had some scandalous speculations about what it was teenagers did in their cars. I backtracked, shuffled the timeline, and pretended I had been talking about small crimes I had comitted that week and would be reporting promptly at the appointed time, not the seeds I had been tending. \n</p>\n<p>\nDelilah and I complemented each other well – she had always been scandalized by curses and sexuality and the dropouts. The concern seemed already to live at the edges of her eyes at seventeen, skeptical creases that deepened when I shared my plans.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I’ve never been able to hide anything from Delilah. She’s always been able to hide things from me, though. Years later I’d think about how I’d always loved her, platonically but intensely, and maybe that blinded me. Maybe she resented the burden of my eyes taking in the way sunlight hit her cheeks, reflected off her hair, brought out the fire in her eyes when she was trying to buy a corn dog. It would make me think of the theory that all photons and electrons are one particle, heading backwards and forwards through all time, weaving its way through each of our histories untold quadrillions of times, and how that would mean I was being bombarded with the light that she was now emanating, how I was made out of it even. And if that legend wasn’t true, still, the light that reached my eyes had touched her first. She must have felt some of the weight of being the subject of those thoughts even with her back turned, and maybe that’s why she did it. Everyone bucks under a yoke. \n</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\n<p>\nRegardless of whether I was dazed by Delilah's light or wrapped up in my own inferno, I didn’t notice when she started to report me. That week was a quiet one for me. Friday night at midnight I laid out a blanket and lay in my backyard, streaming Bright Eyes, naked with a tumbler of mulled wine, basking in the moonlight, thinking of the infinitude of everything. I cried then, for lost Atlantis and for lost coastlines, for the animals I had missed for being born too late. I would never see a whale, or a koala, or a panda. I thought of what was outside this universe, and got dizzy. I drank my wine and went inside and took a bath. I’ve always felt that, if I don’t cry every fortnight or so I start to lose track of myself and become ungrounded, so when it’s been three or so weeks I curate a night of catharsis for myself. I guess that must have been Monday.\n</p>\n<p>\nI didn’t log the session. Wednesday, I didn’t tell the proctors about the skyclad drinking. How could they know?  It didn’t matter, because they did, and they knew for damn sure I hadn’t forgottenb. They knew I meant to. Crime for the pleasure of crime. I refused to admit it, made them sit through the trial, made them play the tape for a jury. By then, less that one percent of people who ended up in prison ever saw a jury, and the prosecutor and judge seemed a bit giddy to be participating in the dated dance. I represented myself, pointed out my actions hadn’t harmed anyone, that no one would have known, that my leading charge was just failure to comply with the Indulgences. I knew it wouldn’t matter. The jury came back in fifteen minutes – wherever their sympathies may have been, had they nullified they would have had to report it and bear the consequences.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"story\">\n<p>\nReformers had diverted resources to the prisons, now named therapeutic resiliance and self-care centers, and they were now full of group therapy and Meaningful Work Opportunities. We got points each day for the hospital corners of our beds, for brushing our teeth, for staying on-task during reading time. Getting enough points resulted in increased privileges – an library expanded from just AA books, first dibs on work assignments, slushies from the local 7-11, permission to wear makeup or use scented hygeine products. We had a top ratings from Vera Institute for Justice. I started to disappear into myself.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Meaningful Work was presented as a therapeutic opportunity. We dredged the filth at the bottom of the internet, moderating to ensure nothing illegal was coming through. There was still a lot - after the Indulgences, the maintainers of Tor were captured in Amsterdam and the government seized control of most of the exit nodes. They let some traffic through so they could follow illicit content to its source. I think they saved this job for prisoners for two reasons: first, it was low paid, unskilled, and the workforce was fungible. Second, exposure to the images left us shellshocked and raw, vulnerable to their psychological predations. We were all wrecks, and weren’t allowed to touch each other because of state regulations on maintaining healthy boundaries  - except for after group therapy. Then, whoever had admitted to a crime would lie on a cot while they played music, and we would all gather around, and touch them, and tell them they were beautiful. They would start weeping and so would we. You can’t express that much love without starting to feel it, even if it’s state-mandated. Every second of our day was prescribed by handbooks, and we were graded on our emotional performance.\n</p>\n<p>\nAt night, I’d think about the free world, and my friends. I never received any letters – almost no one did, as even writing to a prisoner – or client, as they called us - could be considered incriminating. I guess I don’t know it was Delilah that turned me in, I just want it to have been her because I want to have meant something to her. I never heard from anyone. It was easier to have her as my betrayor than to confront the knowledge that so many of us sigh and surrender when the state comes to take our neighbors, our friends, releived it’s not us. Everyone is eager to redefine the boundaries of us to exclude whoever’s gone missing. The criminals and the crazies. The radicals and the revolutionaries. First they came for XXXXXX and I said nothing because I was not XXXXXX.\n</p>\n<p>\nI didn’t know how long I’d be in prison for. My term was set – fourteen months, and the enhancement for secret keeping meant twenty-eight. But I had already received notice before I stepped through the doors that they’d be seeking to hold me for civil confinment afterwards. The counsel I was assigned for this civil hearing blushed at my crime and would only allude to it haltingly. In the two times we met, I don’t think he even named the charge once. Things were awkward, as I couldn’t name it either. Were I to have named to him a crime I would not name to the state, he would have to report me at once and refuse to meet, or be named a co-consipirator in secrecy . They drugged me before the hearing , and I only have the haziest memories of being sentenced to Brooksvale where I would be treated until my criminality desisted.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"story\">\n<p>\nBrooksvale Retreat was in New England, and it had wide green lawns and old oak trees and attachments for handcuffs at every seat. It was populated by people who couldn’t craft a tale of remorse compelling enough for the boards, or who wouldn’t. The prisoners had been mostly black and brown people and this was even more true now in civil commitment, where the only way out was to tug the heartstrings of the alabaster magistrates perched high on the Parole Board, appointed by a state governor afraid to be viewed as soft on crime. I was an easy admit for them because of the gravity of my crime combined with my own deranged levity. We worked there too, molding and baking coasters and phone holders and crafting birdcages that hipsters would use to decorate their lonely houses. They kept us heavily medicated, and we weren’t allowed to have conversations outside of staff earshot. There wasn’t really therapy any more – we were none of us expected to recover.\n</p>\n<p>\nI got more used to my fellow clients. We were all there for the long haul. “The only way out is to die”  they whispered in the ears of newcomers, and then, after a while, we’d whisper it to one another like a talisman in tender moments. We’d sometimes illicitly brush hands, or push knees together, and with these small acts of resistance I fed the flame in me, though I couldn’t feel its warmth through the antipsychotics. I whispered most with Owen, who I’d gathered had been in some sort of resistence movement from his tattoos and scars. It wasn’t much, just once a week or so. But I came to love him, just the same, just as I had once loved Delilah. Connecting to the fierce and pure loyalty I had once felt would sometimes burn through the psychiatric fog and I’d remember I was a person, and could love.\n</p>\n<p>\n A new proctor, Ander, came weekly, but he was no compelling, warm proctor of the free world, seductive and inviting intimacy; Ander was cold and grey and the sort of person one would be afraid to tell you’d seen spinach in their teeth, let alone about any lawbreaking. No one would come and he’d sit, glowering for an hour or so before storming out. It didn’t matter – what meaningful thing could any of us have to report? We were drugged to the gills and sat watching television all day anyway. Things were getting worse outside, from what I could gather the proctor’s computer system had an upgrade, and people were now being indexed and cross-indexed and busted for failing to inform on their friends. It had become a race now, after every small act of wrongdoing, to pick up your phone and report before the other did, if you didn’t quite trust them not to tell. If the proctors came to know of your crime before you reported it, the Draconian old time punishments would come back. The prisons were getting full, and our center got full too – it was at triple capacity and we had to take shifts sleeping on makeshift cots. I didn’t mind; the understaffing meant sometimes my meds were delayed, or even missed, and in the moments of lucidity I’d sit as close to Owen as I dared, closer now that the staff were stretched thin, and we’d tell stories – mine of my small resistances, he of his more daring ones. \n</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"story\">\n<p>\nI don't know how, but the staff caught on to the whispers, and though we protested it was just the same phrase repeated over and over, rubbed shiny and smooth of any meaning and never particularly incindiary in the first place, it should have been reported. They brought in the proctor and lowered our medication suddenly, so we would be unstable, so we would bend. I was sent in first, and as I lay down I felt something cold and wet and hostile on my forehead – an EEG, the words drifted to me from a long time ago.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Do you have anything to report, inmate?” asked Ander and I noticed that he really did have spinach in his teeth, and no one had told him. I started laughing, and he scowled.\n</p>\n<p>\nI was there for days, and I told him nothing. I knew this would be my third strike, and I knew that meant they would send me to the kind of prison that the nonprofits don’t care about reforming, one for the incorrigible, who would never return to society to darken their streets again. But I couldn’t stop laughing . \n</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<h1>\nWhat we talk about when we talk about not testifying\n</h1>\n\n\n<div class=\"story\">\n<p>\nPeople are animals with laws and democracies and formal systems of domination and subordination, and elaborate rules driven by arcane principles and historical quirks. Part mold, spreading to occupy any place there is air and moisture and something to metabolize, and part fractal, with intricate and infinitely detailed and subtle rules within rules. As we’ve grown and branched, we’ve come up with systems for trials, systems of rules that determine if other rules have been broken. Among the most fundamental and yet ungrounded of the rules structuring the theater of court is the right against self-incrimination.  The so-called right is undermined in a thousand ways. As a society, we have agreed that there should be a sanctified right against self-incrimination, and a privilege against incrimination between people and a select few of their fellows. But given the prevalence of coercing testimony, plea bargains, the criminalization of everyday activities and the coercion into criminalization of marginalized groups, this thing we agreed to hold sacred as a society is so riddled with exceptions as to provide nearly no cover on a systemic level. This points to the illegitimacy of our criminal legal system as a whole and its incapacity to protect even the things it claims to hold most dear.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt is hard to connect the right against self-incrimination to the reasons we ostensibly have laws – preventing social unrest, regulating and ordering people, providing a vehicle by which state violence may retain legitimacy while being brought to bear on our flimsy bodies. The riddle is generally answered by recalling the cruel trilemma. \n</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\n<p>\n  The cruel trilemma is this: when a court asks a defendant to testify against themselves, they are faced with the following choice:\n</p>\n<p>\n1.  Protest innocence and earn the ire and displeasure of the court, destroying their very soul in the process if the claim to innocence is false.\n</p>\n<p>\n2.  Confess and receive immediate punishment, often (given the common law origins of the right, in a world in which capital theft was still common) death.\n</p>\n<p>\n3.  Remain silent, refusing the destruction of the soul through perjury or the annihilation of the body through confession, and wither away, at considerable state expense.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe state boasts that it is too kind to make you choose only two of your honor, your liberty, or your life. This usual explanation is nonsensical. As if the state would balk at this metaphysical cruelty, when they’re out executing unarmed kids. It’s the soul they can’t touch, and that once, they decided they shouldn’t. It would make too many secular martyrs. Perhaps this right is grounded in the idea that as a society we don’t want to be so stifling that we prosecute people for things only they know of. After all, if something can only be shown through self-incrimination, then there is no one to speak of it and it left no mark on the earth. And without laws against self-incrimination, every criminal is now a criminal twice over – once for the crime and once for the silence in every moment after the crime. They are stuck in a fallen state of ongoing and relentless criminality in every breath they take. \n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h1>How to lose it</h1>\n  <div class=\"story\">\n  Bakuninist hackers, in a futile effort to strike at the totalitarian state of 2032 had released the First Stone files, and there in digital bits were all our violations, our misdemeanors and felonies. Secretary of State Cruz had been torrenting Green Day. Nancy Pelosi had directed her personal assistant to order Adderall to spike her staffers’ coffee from Silk Road 11. President Barr had been looking at deepfakes of his granddaughter. The Secret Service, which had been working overtime, stumbled but carried on. They knew how to hide their brutality even from the neo-Bakuninists. For a while, the hoped-for chaos and loss of legitimacy had ensued, and federal prosecutors, the few who were not newly-public felons, had their hands full. \n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\n  Some smirked, having foreseen this disaster. An overeager system of condemnation and prosecution meant to keep every citizen in check  had at last been equitably applied to the mighty as well as the small.\n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\nThen came the Accountability Act. The Catholic legal movement, J. D. Vance at the helm, had been working on setting the table for Project Indulgences for years at meetings of the esoteric Federalist Society Immaterialist Working Group. This group held legislation ready to deploy in moments of crisis. The Reichstag was the home of the German parlaiment, and four weeks after Hitler was elected Chancellor the magnificent building was burned to the ground. The nation had been in a swing from the decadent, Cabaret-style freedoms of the Weimar Republic to the clutches of fascism, but the burning of the Reichstag was all the Fascists needed to seize total control. Several communists were arrested and tried, and some were exiled or sentenced to death. Later, historians claimed that the fire may have been an inside job, but most agreed it was a stroke of luck for the Fascists. Authoritarians realized how well-advised they would be to have a PATRIOT Act or its ilk in their back pocket, for the next time. That’s what the Working Group was for.\n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\nThe freshman congressman from Mississippi, a bearded and purple-faced man who invoked God at least five times in each of his spittle-spraying tirades on liberty, introduced a bill prohibiting prosecution for prior foibles. Instead, the bill laid out a system of self-reporting combined with fines, for those who could pay them, or loss of rights for those who could not. It was framed as supremely merciful – after all, with all crimes being reported, the punishment for each could be a mere trifle. Congress, who had been heading to work in movie-star sunglasses and anti-paparazzi tie bars to avoid cameras and jeers, made this bill law.\n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\n  A few members of the Supreme Court protested, vigorously (or as Fox News characterized it that night, shrilly and hysterically) that this represented a loss of Fifth Amendment rights, but the seven Justices who had been implicated in the scandal pointed out that, as only three percent of cases ever went to trial  and were settled for bargain sentences in exchange for guilty pleas, nothing had really changed. The groundwork was already set and this was a logical extension, they argued, desparate for their own crimes to be washed away. They promised an end to the dystopian state of affairs where the values the country swore to and those it promulgated were at odds, the state speaking from both sides of its mouth. Henceforth, Justice Kavanaugh wrote, the bench would be comitted to straight shooting.\n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\n  Civil liberties advocates were horrified, but then they were the most vulnerable. Their extensive FBI files with years of licentuous and lascivious and petty conduct hadn’t been shared by the hackers, who wanted to spare their natural allies the shame they visited on the rest of the population. This was a mistake of ideology, because it made the great reveal seem less idealistic; but even more it was a mistake of strategy because now those advocates were uniquely vulnerable to blackmail, and the feds sprang into action. Every civil libertarian was now receiving visits from hassled federal agents, working overtime and rolling their eyes at the continuous stream of ‘Come Back with a Warrant’ doormats. They helpfully slipped the information they had – just for the protection and knowledge of the activists, of course – into mailboxes . \n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\nRealizing their misstep, the Bakuninists dumped the files of everyone from Senator Ocasio-Cortez (using knowledge of future bills to help construct know your rights trainings ahead of schedule) to Chelsea Manning (it was illegal that she had been online at all, and that the content was merely cat memes hardly mattered) to staffers at the Electronic Fronteir Foundation (torrenting truly humiliating amounts of Cowboy Bebop) and some progressives who had been into darker stuff, and the pundits seized on this new dirt with vigour, as many of those activists had risen to new prominence after the crackdown. The liberals turned on them the most brutally, the ACLU’s funding was decimated, and the fight went out of everyone. And so the Indulgence Era began. \n</div>\n\n<h1>Panopticonism</h1>\n<div class=\"quote\">\nHe who is subjected to a field of visibility, and who knows it, assumes responsibility for the constraints of power; he makes them play spontaneously upon himself; he inscribed in himself the power relation in which he simultaneously plays both roles; he becomes the principle of his own subjection.\n\n― Michel Foucault, Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison\n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\nA person needs some privacy to thrive and to breathe. We all start out small and grow, and to be human we need secrets. If your crime is a crime against God and not man, it should feed your soul, so you can use it to grow and change. \n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"story\">\n<p>\nAnd shouldn’t we have the right to rebel, to plan and plot, as long as we can do it without disturbing anyone? If no one is willing to speak out against me for my so-called crimes, and they leave no mark upon the world, maybe the state, this body erected and held aloft by the people itself, has no authority or jurisdiction upon these so-called crimes that offend no one. The lawbreaking that fits into this category, of rules you break that no one but you could speak of, that don’t leave their mark on this world, is limited. I think it’s limited because we have this right – because of it, how could we enforce such laws? Crossdressing. Witchcraft. Worship. Deals with the devil. Masturbation. I guess we still have some ineffable crimes, like walking alone at night through a dawn to dusk park, or during the day through an abandoned coat factory, or across the street when the red man and not the green is showing. Living in the wild mountains. \n</p>\n<p>\nOf course, this right to privacy framework has a shred of moral bankruptcy at its core. Why should my right to practice witchcraft or be a faggot be predicated on private practice of that right. Other people can be straight Christians in the daylight, you know? Walking around with ash on their foreheads, making out on each others laps. Surely by arguing that these things are ok specifically because they cannot be seen, because they are tucked away into tired corners, we are validating and ossifying our own oppression? These crimes are not protected because of any right to privacy, they are protected because as soon as the government tries to stop them they disintegrate, nimbly hopping from ground to secreter and more gossamer ground. \n</p>\n</div>\n<h1>Friendship and the licensing of trust</h1>\n<div class=\"story\">\nI’ve been reading a lot these days about best-friend-ships between children, mostly girls. My Brilliant Friend and Never Let Me Go in particular. I had that kind of friendship when I was little, a serial friendship monogamist, sharing every thought. I’ve also been reading a lot of John Grisham books, with cobwebbed rural men who share nothing, who are incapable of externalizing their internal life, on trial for brutal murders. The girls, though, break the law too. \n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\nFor the men who have murdered, or who have not, much is made of their decision not to testify, or to testify in their own defenses. The Reckoning is a sprawling novel about a man who refuses to speak in his own defense, and what that means for his community, his children, his wife, his war buddies. Much of the book lingers on his time as a prisoner of war in Japan, the brutality, his bravery. He is never asked to speak against his fellows and while, over and over again, other rules regulating the treatment of prisoners are shattered the Japanese captors never ask the men to violate this one taboo.\n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\nBetween intimates, sometimes an expectation emerges that we will testify against ourselves. In our closest friendships or in romantic partnerships. This is normal and healthy; in our confidantes we have a truer mirror than in the echoes of our own brains. The other times people are asked to bear witness to their sins are to clergy who once saved the souls of the many, to therapists who seem to have picked up where the clergy failed, and to doctors, who save the body where the soul resides. Soldiers in war together, who save one another. And lawyers, who save our liberty, our property, and sometimes our lives. To fail to testify to your own crimes to a spouse, your clergy person, your therapist would be a betrayal of the other and of yourself.  The law, beautifully and poetically and perhaps given its normal violence and brutality surprisingly, protects these confidences.\n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\nUnless those intimates are bound by nothing but fellowship or blood. The intimacy has to be at the blessing of the state, which can’t control or license our tenderness or our mammalian reproduction. It can, though, license weddings, therapists, doctors and clergy. It can give us a gun and a platoon. The state never gave our souls the permission to live in our bodies.\n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\nThis all comes at a great cost to friendships, and friendships, outside of elite circles, are anathema to the state. They are where rebellion is bred. When friends and families can be forced to testify against each other or be confined for years under charges of civil and criminal contempt, closeness is tempered by a constant awareness that the leviathan with a monopoly on force can come in at any moment and demand a choice between betrayal or confinement.\n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\nThis system, which allows state-sanctioned confidentiality of the sort needed to grow as a person and to protect your body and your interests, requires expensive licensing and the total assimilation of the party holding the confidences to the expectations of the white supremacist, heteropatriarchal state. To access it we need to become mechanized components of that state, and thus alienated from the true trust that would make that confidentiality most valuable. How individualistic! They split us from our blood and our friends and coopt some of us to be proxies for the state and bear some of its authority in a formalized way. Those people now have a vested interest in the continued power of the state and so does everyone who has confessed to them.\n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\nIsn’t queer culture lovers and confessors and therapists and advisors all bound up with each other and unlicensed and so vulnerable to state violence it’s like a slavering dog breathing down your neck? When queer communities take to community self-defense, they become supremely vulnerable to being asked to testify against themselves .\n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\nQueers exist different distances from the ideal neoliberal subject. Long-term monogamous queers who aspire to possess a nuclear family, who have property, who have jobs with healthcare and citizenship, are close to being as good as a straight married people are in the eyes of the state. Before gay marriage, many queers who fit all of those criteria were partnered with those who met only some, and sought marriage licenses in order to grant healthcare, immunity from deportation, and property rights for their lovers, all the better to form a nuclear family with. Without the goal of gay marriage, these queers – so close to being ideal subjects – would still find themselves in solidarity with fights for real civil rights, universal healthcare, protections from deportation, and social services. Now that gay marriage has been achieved, that solidarity is gone, replaced with assimilation to the world of patriarchy and property. Licensable forms of queerness are no longer deviant these formations benefit from the 1000+ rights granted to married people by the State. The interests of the assimilated queers are now the interests of the straights – defend the comfortable territory of full citizenship from criminals, perverts, and freaks. In fact, the state has weaponized and co-opted queerness, defanged and declawed it. There are now ways to be ostensibly queer and also to be an ideal capitalist subject. Just ask Budweiser, the Bank of America, and the marriage-industrial complex. Just ask Pete Buttigieg.\n</div>\n<h1>Gangs, Friendship, and Insurgency</h1>\n<div class=\"quote\">\nAt the shrine of friendship, never say die\n<br />\nLet the wine of friendship never run dry\n<br />\nHere's to you and here's to me\n<br />\nLes Misérables, the night before the revolution\n<br />\n<br />\nI never had a group of friends before\n<br />\nI promise that I'll make y'all proud\n<br />\nHamilton, in Hamilton, deciding to join the revolution\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\n<p>\nAt the core of every revolution is friendship, and licensed relationships act as a reactionary force against that revolutionary core. A license represents a solidified moment in subject-formation, a moment in time in which one is crystalized as a legal entity rather than a person to be described with the word folks.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The state knows that insurgency requires friendships. Thus, the creation of gang databases, which land people – mostly black and brown men – in a database for targeting and harassment based on song lyrics, or being seen in certain areas, or wearing certain colors. \n</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"wrapper\">\n <div class=\"item\">\n    <div class=\"polaroid\">\n      <img src=\"pink.jpg\" />\n      <div class=\"caption\">Figure 4: On Wednesdays, we wear pink.</div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n <div class=\"item\">\n    <div class=\"polaroid\">\n      <img src=\"nypd.jpg\" />\n      <div class=\"caption\">Figure 5: NYPD Requirements to be listed as a gang associate.</div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\n \nAccording to Carl Hardrick of Hartford, a community anti-violence activist , gangs largely consist of 20% people who are invoved in violence, 20% people who are pursuing education and positive lives along legal lines and who are generally very positive role models, and 60% people who fall in between those two extremes. Attempts to index, categorize and harass all members of ‘gangs’ is a form of racial profiling, because the same could be said of members of other groups. Making gangs into a single category and labeling the whole thing a set of criminal enterprises, even while acknowledging that many ‘gangs’ are just groups of kids that live in a building or on a street, is equivalent to calling the board of every company a corrupt organization, and treating membership in a company board as an adverse fact in sentencing. But that would never happen, because being on the boards of companies serves the interest of capital. In fact, even behavior that very closely mimics the behavior of gangs is dismissed as ‘boys being boys’ when the members of the group are from a high social class, as was the case for Malibu Locals Only, a collection of young people, many of whom had powerful and wealthy parents, who law enforcement refused to categorize as a gang . Malibu Locals Only beat many people unprovoked, one of them nearly to death but it was formed to protect property rights of private beaches.\n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\nConsider the strategems used by federal law enforcement for the targeting of radical social movements. Over the last century, the approaches have grown more secretive, from the brutal open shooting of participants in the labor movement and Fred Hampton to the more insidious but still public House Un-American Committee. Strategies for suffocating insurgency have evolved to become more secretive if not less brutal. Counter-Intelligence Program of infiltration, blackmail and paranoia-sowing. \n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\n<p>\nFriendship, after all, is an effective tool against counterinsurgency. \n</p>\n<p>\n\nIn the fifties, the most effective sanction was terror. \nAlmost any publicity from HUAC meant the \"blacklist.\" \nWithout a chance to clear his name, a witness would suddenly find himself without friends and without a job. \nBut it is not easy to see how in 1969 a HUAC blacklist could terrorize an SDS activist. \nWitnesses like Jerry Rubin have openly boasted of their contempt for American institutions. \nA subpoena from HUAC would be unlikely to scandalize Abie Hoffman or his friends.\n</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1969/2/24/by-any-other-name-pthe-house/\">The Harvard Crimson, February 1969</a>\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen we build our associations through our jobs, and through contracts, we are vulnerable to operations like the House Un-American Activities Committee and the idea of forming an illegal union is unthinkable. With friendship, the State has had to bring their efforts to destroy insurgency into the darkness, to attack our friendship directly. They have shifted their strategies from attacking friends to attacking friendship as an institution. \n</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\nThey do this through two strategies: terroristic control and alienation. Terror includes gang databases and punitive sentencing for gang membership, grand jury witch hunts, detainment at borders, anti-protesting laws, anti-gathering laws, and policing groups of suspicious people. Terror is open, and openly vitriolic. When the government terrorizes friends, we huddle together, sheltering from the rancid breath and acrid spittle of its mottled face screaming about patriotism, giggling together about the ridiculousness of the uniforms. Once, I was facing a line of riot cops, and one of them was wearing his shield upside-down. There was no chaos, so he couldn’t turn it right-side up. We mocked his until he turned red and wilted, his militarized body becoming a bit human. The violent hand of the state \n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\nBut sometimes the State drives alienates insurgent friends from each other, weakening social ties instead of terrorizing them. One of the most effective strategies for reducing mosquito populations is to introduce females into the population that will produce sterile offspring. The state introduces resources that sterilize friendships. It introduces sterile substitutes for friendship.\nBut they also alienate us from insurgent friendship.\n• Mandatory reporting\n• Surveillance\n• Policing in schools\nThe state hs\nGenerational change\n• Bowling alone\n• Internet\n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\n<h1>Oaths, Apparatchiks, and Folks</h1>\nCalling people folks is a cliché of queer culture and political culture; it just means people and could almost always have the word people slotted in. But folk has another meaning too; folk art, folk culture, folk music – it’s of and by the people. Folk things are generally unlicensed – only when capitalism comes into a country like a fire, stripping people of all they have, does folk art become a licensable thing. It feels like the mere act of being granted an official position with the state where you have special privileges and are immune against testifying – where the state grants you discretion – removes you from the world of being folks. The antonym of folk is apparatchik, or fiduciary. Folks are a type of creature; licensures remove people from creaturehood. \n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\nTurning people into mandatory reporters, priests, doctors and lawyers removes them from an organic and continuous process of subject formation with influence from friends, lovers, literature, media and, yes, the state and ossifies them into a strictly defined role with strictly defined power relations and responsibilities. Identity formed around this legal role; the newly minted licensee is now responsible to the state. They have likely taken an oath or a vow of the sort we don’t make to our friends and community members and in so doing have bound their souls to the interest of the state continuing. In New York, the oath goes “I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support the constitution of the United States, and the constitution of the State of New York, and that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the office of [attorney and counselor-at-law], according to the best of my ability. ” If I do my best to mediate disputes between my queer friends, or I tutor SAT problems, or I’m a programmer for Google, I can also be in community with people – folks – I don’t need to swear on my soul to support a document written by genocidal slavers. Even the Hippocratic Oath, sworn (upon occasion) by doctors involves a vow of loyalty, first, to other doctors before loyalty to a community or solidarity outside of that elite class. \n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\n<br />\nI do solemnly swear, by whatever I hold most sacred, that I will be loyal to the profession of medicine and just and generous to its members.\n<br />\nThat I will lead my life and practice my art in uprightness and honor\n<br />\nThat into whatsoever home I shall enter it shall be for the good of the sick and the well to the utmost of my power and that I will hold myself aloof from wrong and from corruption and from tempting others to vice.\n<br />\nThat I will exercise my art solely for the cure of my patients and the prevention of disease and will give no drugs and perform no operation for a criminal purpose and far less suggest such a thing. That whatsoever I shall see or hear of the lives of men and women which is not fitting to be spoke, I will keep inviolably secret.\n<br />\nThese things I do promise and in proportion as I am faithful to this oath, may happiness and good repute be ever mine, the opposite if I shall be forsworn.\n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\nFair enough. But this oath isn’t mandatory to be a doctor; it’s specific to individual schools. To be a doctor you do, however, have to be fingerprinted and disclose all crimes. This is despite the fact that while harm is distributed disproportionately to wealthier, whiter communities overall, criminality is distributed to poorer, less white communities . Priests, too, take vows of loyalty to the Church and to God. \n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\nThese vows take people out of solidarity with one another and put them into solidarity, instead, with power – specifically the power of the state. Once they are licensed and vowed to the state, and entrusted with the secrets of their community, they are no longer folks. Instead, they are just more eyes of the state who have a personal investment in its failure.\n</div>\n<h1>Being Creatures</h1>\n<div class=\"quote\">\nIndeed, one of the central concerns of the new Mechanical Philosophy was the mechanics of the body, whose constitutive elements – from the circulation of the blood to the dynamics of speech, from the effects of sensations to voluntary and involuntary motions – were taken apart and classified in all their components and possibilities. \n...<br />\nOnce its devices were deconstructed and it was itself reduced to a tool, the body could be opened to an infinite manipulation of its powers and possibilities.\n<br />\n  Silvia Federici, Caliban and the Witch\n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\n<p>\nSilvia Federici is an anarcha-feminist Marxist, and she knows we’re animals with spirits and hedge witches and ultimately creatures who love, and feel. In Caliban and the Witch, Federici traces the great intellectual project to turn the human body into lifeless lump of flesh and then re-animate it as a machine in order to better control it as a tool of capital – but also as a better subject of investigation and punishment. The state helps itself gluttonously to our hair, our phone-opening fingerprints, our blood and excrement, the way we wear a shirt, the paths our pens trace on a page, and even the electrons we send through our neurons. \n</p>\n<p>\nSome of our bodies are self-incriminating even before we’ve broken any statute. Trans bodies. The bodies of those who, once pregnant, have miscarried. A lack of a hymen on a wedding night, tattoos vowing a suspect solidarity. Matching the racialized descriptions on the nightly news. \n</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\nLawyers are now countenancing making our very brain activation patterns admissible against us. Neuroscience and brain scans are not, in fact, actually close to showing interrogators the contents of our minds, but most forensic science is already profitable confabulation and brain scans are about to have a great return on investment . The brilliant idea is based on this insight from neuroscience: When we see something we’ve seen before, our brain lights up in a way it wouldn’t if we hadn’t seen the thing before. The argument goes that this is non-testimonial, that it navigates through the perilous waters of the Cruel Trilemma because the accused makes no decision. Of course, the argument does not countenance that someone might show the accused an image of the crime scene before the infalliable brain fingerprinting session. The neuroscientist coolly brings the scan to the witness booth, can even examine the defendant in real time. It’s science. Nevermind that having seen the photo, or even dreamed of the event over and over after imprisonment for its comission could generate the same evidence of ‘having seen the evidence before’.\n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\nLike our squishy brains, our subconscious can testify against us. Tacky as it may be to mention John Grisham twice, The Innocent Man deals largely with self-incriminating dream confessions delivering people to death row in the small town of Ada, Oklahoma. People locked up for life for confiding in police a dream in which they confessed, and having those confessions thrown on the stand. Maybe they thought their dreams would set them free. Soon their dreams would be the only time they’d have. “Sleep is cherished on The Row, and many of the men spend half of each day in another world. When you’re sleeping, you’re cheating the system. Sleep is your time, not the state’s” \n</div>\n<h1>Fascism</h1>\n<div class=\"story\">\nFascism doesn’t really need protections against self-incrimination, because it doesn’t really need protections against anything. It would be nonsensical. Under fascism, you’re part of the state, or not. A fasces is a bundle of sticks tied all together in parallel, often with an axe in it. Used to represent state power, the idea of a right against self-incrimination under fascism is as nonsensical as the idea of a cog’s right to keep its inner fractures secret. The thing with moral agency, to serve and beautiful and bask in the light isn’t a person, there is no god and no soul. The glorious state is the only thing with agency and its glory is the only thing to serve. It’s like an ant colony, or bees – the individual is neither good nor bad, more like a complex cell with a bit of decision-making power, but freely sacrificial for the good of the whole. Guilt doesn’t really matter. “Nazi Germany’s foremost constitutional lawyer, Carl Schmitt, advanced a theory which generalized this a priori culpability. A thief, for example, was not necessarily one who has committed an overt act of theft but rather one whose character renders him a thief”. Angela Davis, Political Prisoners, Prisons and Black Liberation. This theory is echoed in the words of Trump characterizing Mexican migrants as ‘rapists’ or in the justification behind stop and frisk, grounded in ‘suspicion’. \n</div>\n<h1>Parole hearings are struggle sessions</h1>\n<div class=\"quote\">\n  No!’ exclaimed O’Brien. His voice had changed extraordinarily, and his face had suddenly become both stern and animated. ‘No! Not merely to extract your confession, not to\npunish you. Shall I tell you why we have brought you here? To cure you! To make you sane! Will you understand, Winston, that no one whom we bring to this place ever leaves our hands uncured? We are not interested in those stupid crimes that you have committed. The Party is not interested in the overt act: the thought is all we care about. We do not merely destroy our enemies, we change them.\n-George Orwell, 1984\n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\n  Once bound to the status of criminal, the right against self-incrimination is only nominal. The State, acting on our behalf, accomplishes this trick with Draconian sentences that can be chipped away via ‘good time’ and via parole hearings. Parole hearings require a showing of remorse, one that is beleivable to a panel of professional hearers of remorse. To be fair, many people in prison do feel a deep and profound remorse of the actions that brought them there, and want to break cycles of violence and be accountable and make amends. That is commendable. But being granted parole isn’t about a spiritual and material commitment to repairing harm as much as it is about taking responsibility in the eyes of the state.\n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\n  Why have we set up a system in which self-accusation and self-abasement is incentivized by years out from behind bars? Good deeds and kindness and productivity are all helpful, but none of them is dispositive in the same way self-accusation is. Rather than demanding reparations for harm done, or an attempt at reparations, what a parole hearing demands is submission to the Constitution and penological ideology. It serves state interests to enforce compliance with and assimilation to dominiant ideologies and commitment to law and order; it does not serve state interests to prioritize reparations and the mending of marginalized communities. \n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\nNot every instance of using confession as a tool for control requires an direct accusation of criminality. In the United States we have grand juries, where activists and revolutionaries are routinely confined for over a hyear for declining to testify at secret hearings. \n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\nIf the pursuit of radicals whose solidarity makes them resistent to normal tools of prosecution seems too remote, consider a state in which eligibility for freedom and citizenship is built on crime-free confessions as a starting point. Struggle sessions were Lenin’s idea. The concept is that, with one party, people need a way to hold themselves and one another accountable, and at first the routine of criticism and self-criticism worked well. Anarchist eco-feminist militians in Northern Syria do something similar before each day of battle, where each participant has the opporunity to criticize both themselves and one another. Many classrooms and organizations have a similar ritual in going through their personal ‘glows’ and ‘grows’, as well as those for the classroom and group. Companies have self-assessments. \"[S]elf-criticism is as necessary to us as air or water. I think that without it, without self-criticism, [we] could not make any headway, could not disclose our ulcers, could not eliminate our shortcomings. And shortcomings we have in plenty. That must be admitted frankly and honestly.\" It would sound as natural in a TED talk as it did coming from Stalin’s lips. This attitude can be healthy, but then it isn’t the state, the group with a monopoly on the legitimate use of force, demanding them.\n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\nStruggle sessions were started by the Bolsheviks but there’s very little information on this probably because racism. The most powerful images of struggle sessions come from China during the Cultural Revolution. The deal was this: confess your previous, bourgeis capitalist ideology and join the reveolution or be publicly shamed, indefinitely until you confessed. University professors in particular were popular targets. Mao argued that “dust will accumulate if a room is not cleaned regularly, our faces will get dirty if they are not washed regularly. Our comrades' minds and our Party's work may also collect dust, and also need sweeping and washing”. And self-criticism is already starting to make a comeback: “For many Chinese of a certain age, criticism and self-criticism sessions are synonymous with public humiliation and brutal punishment. … The meeting was like a bath that made everyone’s face blush, made everyone sweat and got rid of all the toxins,” said an article in China Meteorological Weekly last month, referring to a session held by the China Meteorological Administration.”  \n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\nIs cancel culture like a struggle session? It is not, for two reasons. First, cancel culture is a form of insurgent accountability, not a totalization of the dominant ideology. For people who are ‘cancelled’, it can feel as though an uninterrupted array of voices stand in condemnation of them. \n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\nHowever, cancel culture can also be anti-insurgent and degrade solidarity when it becomes part of disposability culture. \n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\nParole eligibility hearings are really a form of struggle session, with stakes at least as high as under totalitarian communist rule. The correctly and wrongfully convicted alike will not be released, decades after their conviction, until they express remorse via the form of pageantry called for by parole hearing boards. People who did commit crimes but now see their acts as political, or who committed crimes in service of political goals, or who falsely confessed under duress, or as children, or as a vulnerable stooge in what the Miranda opinion calls a ‘Mutt and Jeff act’  are yet resilient in front of a parole board, where they have nothing to gain by refusing to testify falsely to their remorse – nothing but their soul.\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h1>\nDespair and policy recommendations: a “system so odious as to give rise to a demand for its total abolition”\n</h1>\n<div class=\"quote\">\nWhile the admissions or confessions of the prisoner, when voluntarily and freely made, have always ranked high in the scale of incriminating evidence, if an accused person be asked to explain his apparent connection with a crime under investigation, the ease with which the questions put to him may assume an inquisitorial character, the temptation to press the witness unduly, to browbeat him if he be timid or reluctant, to push him into a corner, and to entrap him into fatal contradictions, which is so painfully evident in many of the earlier state trials, notably in those of Sir Nicholas Throckmortion, and Udal, the Puritan minister, made the system so odious as to give rise to a demand for its total abolition…\n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\nThe essential and inherent cruelty of compelling a man to expose his own guilt is obvious to everyone and needs no illustration.

I feel across time and space an affinity for Justice Brown (I’m sure truly a monster in many ways) but who in attempting to articulate the deep NO he felt to the idea of coerced self-incrimination seems to lose all reason, to resort to words like essential, inherent, degradation, abhorrence, painful, fatal, odious and, of course, total abolition.\n</div>\n<div class=\"story\">\nJustice Brown, in this opinion, denied the ability of reformist legislators to statute their way around the abuses of policemen in dark rooms.
