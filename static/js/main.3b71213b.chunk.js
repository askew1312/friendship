Mandatory reporting is probably a good thing. But having people who are mandatory reporters, and others with mandatory confidentiality, binds us to roles and rules and regulations outside of our hearts. It makes it easier to imagine, also, what a world without a right against self-incrimination might resemble. As soon as you tell the beloved nurturer, posed as a surrogate mother, or brother, you are telling the authorities and exposing any malefactors to the state, whether you intended to or not. For a mandatory reporter, secret-keeping exposes them directly to state violence, while truth-telling might expose others to such violence. For instance, attorneys who must report any suspicious of child neglect risk exposing children to a brutal form of state care and violate client trust and confidentiality at the same time.
